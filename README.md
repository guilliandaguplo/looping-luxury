# This Week's Topic\!
**For Loops, Classes, Vectors**

In this module, students will learn how to apply ``loops``along with ``Classes`` and ``Vectors`` to automate tedious and repetitive tasks.

## Theme
**Imagine** you are working for a start up company that resells luxury brand items\. An important aspect of a successful online business is establishing communication with customers after the first interaction\.

 So your boss decides to task you with reaching out to customers, welcoming them with a **personalized email** that thanks them for their first purchase and encourages them to consider the company for future luxury brand purposes\.

 Now imagine **thousands** of orders coming in and **manually** typing each letter\! It would be very time consuming\. To avoid this, your **goal** is to create a program that will send those automated emails our for us\!

## Goal
 You will create a program that will write a templatized message given an array of customers and the item(s) that they bought.

 (Store class objects in arrays

# Tasks:
- [ ] Create an array to represent the customers we have to email.

- [ ] Create a class to represent the customer and their cart.

- [ ] Add functions that compose the message based on customers name and the items they bought.

- [ ] Store the customer in a vector of class objects then pass the customer to a function that will use for loops to iterate inside the vector of customers to “send” the email until there is no more.


# Long Term Goal
**Be able to comfortably use for loops to iterate through a given array of varying sizes and extract info based on inside the array.**
